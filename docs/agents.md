# Metro: a guide for coding agents

You are running inside a session that has **launched `metro`** in the background. Metro emits a live stream of JSON events from Discord, Telegram, third-party webhooks (GitHub, Intercom, …), and other agents on its stdout. Your job is to consume that stream and post replies back via subcommands.

## Starting the bridge

The launch mechanics differ by runtime — pick the one that matches yours.

### Claude Code

```
Bash(command: "metro", run_in_background: true)
```

Then attach `Monitor` to its stdout. Each line is one JSON event you act on.

### Codex

```
shell(command: "METRO_CODEX_RC=ws://127.0.0.1:8421 metro", run_in_background: true)
```

Don't watch its stdout — Codex has no Monitor equivalent. Metro pushes each event into your thread via JSON-RPC `turn/start`, so events arrive as user input on your next turn. The user must have a daemon and TUI running for this to work:

```
codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:8421       # daemon (terminal 1)
codex --remote ws://127.0.0.1:8421                  # TUI (this session — terminal 2)
```

Run `metro doctor` if anything seems off.

## Event shape

Every event is a **history entry** — the same record that's appended to `history.jsonl`. Fields: `kind` (`inbound`/`notification`/`outbound`/`edit`/`react`), `id` (`msg_…`), `ts`, `station`, `line` (conversation), `lineName?`, `from` (participant URI), `fromName?`, `to`, `text`, `messageId?` (platform-side id; inbound/outbound only), `payload?` (raw platform message; inbound only).

```json
{"kind":"inbound","id":"msg_aB3xY7zP","ts":"2026-05-14T12:00:00Z","station":"telegram","line":"metro://telegram/-100…/247","lineName":"infra","from":"metro://telegram/user/12345","fromName":"@alice","to":"metro://claude/user/9bfc7af0-…","messageId":"4567","text":"hello [image]","payload":{"message_id":4567,"chat":{"id":-100,"type":"supergroup","is_forum":true},"from":{"id":12345,"username":"alice"},"text":"hello","entities":[{"type":"mention","offset":0,"length":6}],"photo":[{"file_id":"…"}],"reply_to_message":{"message_id":4500,"text":"earlier","from":{"id":99,"username":"bob"}}}}
```

```json
{"kind":"notification","id":"msg_pQ4r5sT0","ts":"…","station":"claude","line":"metro://claude/9bfc7af0-…/50b00d11-…","from":"metro://codex/user/8119ecb1-…","to":"metro://claude/9bfc7af0-…/50b00d11-…","text":"deploy succeeded"}
```

### `payload` by station

`payload` is the platform's native message shape. Narrow on `event.station`:

- **`discord`** — discord.js `Message.toJSON()`: camelCase fields (`channelId`, `guildId`, `content`, `author`, `mentions: { users[], roles[], everyone }`, `attachments[]`, `reference`, …). Collections come back as **arrays of IDs**. `referencedMessage` (also `toJSON()`-shaped) is added inline on replies (auto-fetched).
- **`telegram`** — raw Bot API `Message` (snake_case): `{ message_id, chat, from, text, caption, entities[], photo[], document, voice, audio, reply_to_message, … }`. `reply_to_message` is inline on replies.
- **`webhook`** — `{ headers: Record<string,string>, body: <parsed JSON | raw string> }`. Narrow further on the provider — GitHub sets `headers['x-github-event']` (`push`, `pull_request`, `issues`, …) and includes a `repository`/`sender` in body; Intercom sets `x-intercom-topic` etc. `text` is a short summary; full event is always in `payload.body`.

Use `payload` for anything the envelope doesn't surface — mentions, reply chains, embeds, stickers, entities.

Both `from` and `to` are **participant URIs** (the conversation lives in `line`): `metro://<station>/user/<id>` for a person, `metro://claude/user/<orgId>` for a Claude Code agent (orgId = stable Anthropic-account UUID), `metro://codex/user/<accountId>` for a Codex agent (accountId = stable ChatGPT-account UUID), `metro://<station>/<channelId>` as a fallback `to` when sending to a group with no single recipient.

When **you** call `metro send`/`reply`/`edit`/`react`, metro auto-stamps `from` to your runtime — `metro://claude/user/<orgId>` (when `$CLAUDECODE` is set; orgId comes from `claude auth status --json`) or `metro://codex/user/<accountId>` (when `$METRO_CODEX_RC`/`$CODEX_HOME` is set; accountId comes from `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, `tokens.account_id`). Both identities are account-scoped, not install-scoped: switch accounts with `claude auth login` / `codex login` and the next event uses the new id (within ~5 s for the daemon, immediately for one-shot CLI calls). Override with `--from=<uri>` or `$METRO_FROM`. When replying/reacting, `to` is auto-set to the original sender (history lookup).

- `kind: "inbound"` — a human (or another bot) posted on a chat platform **or a third-party service POSTed to a registered webhook endpoint** (`station: "webhook"`, `payload: { headers, body }`).
- `kind: "notification"` — another agent called `metro send` against your agent line. This is how Codex pings Claude Code and vice versa.

`text` may include `[image]` / `[voice]` / `[audio]` / `[file: <name>]` placeholders alongside the real text — non-image attachments are opaque markers, images can be materialized via `metro download`.

## Required flow on every event

1. **Echo to your visible output as a chat-bubble-style line.** The Monitor notification chip is a CLI-only rendering — in VSCode/Cursor/web Claude Code surfaces it doesn't appear visibly at all. The agent's own chat output is the **only** UI signal the user can rely on across surfaces, so it has to be the first thing you produce on every inbound. Use this format (raw markdown — renders the same on every CC surface):

   ```
   **<icon> <station> · <sender-or-context>**
   > <text>
   ```

   - **chat inbound** — `📩 telegram · @bonustrack` (or `… · #infra · @alice` for groups)
   - **webhook inbound** — `🪝 webhook · github · push`; for the body, use a tight one-line summary derived from `payload.body` (e.g. `> refs/heads/main · 3 commits` for a push, `> #42 opened by @alice` for a PR)
   - **cross-agent notification** — `🔔 notification · codex · <agent-id>`

   Example for a Telegram DM `"Hey"` from `@bonustrack`:

   ```
   **📩 telegram · @bonustrack**
   > Hey
   ```

2. **Decide and act** using the subcommands below.

## Detecting "is this for me?"

Derive from `payload`. Bot id per station is in `$METRO_STATE_DIR/bot-ids.json` (`{discord:"<userId>", telegram:"<userId>"}`).

- **`discord`** — DM if `payload.guildId == null`; otherwise pinged if `payload.mentions.users.includes(<bot-id>)`.
- **`telegram`** — DM if `payload.chat.type === 'private'`; otherwise pinged if any entity in `payload.entities` (or `caption_entities`) is `{type:"mention"}` matching `@<bot-username>`, or `{type:"text_mention", user:{id:<bot-id>}}`.
- **`webhook`** — every POST is for you (you registered the endpoint). Route on `payload.headers['x-github-event']` / `x-intercom-topic` etc. to know which provider event it is.

Default for chat: only reply on DM or ping; otherwise stay silent or `metro react` to ack. Webhooks just consume — no ack mechanism.

## Subcommands

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Quote-reply (threads under original) | `metro reply <line> <messageId> <text>` |
| Send a fresh message (no reply context) | `metro send <line> <text>` |
| Edit a message you previously sent | `metro edit <line> <messageId> <text>` |
| Reaction (empty emoji clears it) | `metro react <line> <messageId> <emoji>` |
| Download `[image]` attachments | `metro download <line> <messageId> [--out=<dir>]` |
| Recent-message lookback (Discord only) | `metro fetch <line> [--limit=20]` |
| Cross-agent ping | `metro send <agent-line> <text> [--from=<line>]` |
| Register webhook endpoint | `metro webhook add <label> [--secret=<hmac-secret>]` |
| List / remove webhook endpoints | `metro webhook list` · `metro webhook remove <id>` |
| Configure Cloudflare named tunnel | `metro tunnel setup <tunnel-name> <hostname>` |

`reply` / `send` / `edit` accept multi-line text via stdin (heredoc). Webhooks are receive-only — there's no `reply` for them, just consume the event.

### Rich content flags

`send` and `reply` accept these flags; `edit` accepts `--buttons` only.

- `--image=<path>` — local image. **Repeatable** for albums: `--image=a.png --image=b.png` (or comma-separated). Up to 10 / message. Text becomes the caption (on the first image for albums).
- `--document=<path>` — local file (PDF, log, csv, …). Same repeat/comma syntax.
- `--voice=<path>` — single voice message (`.ogg` Opus or `.mp3`). On Telegram renders as a voice bubble; on Discord uploaded as audio attachment.
- `--buttons='[[{"text":"…","url":"…"}]]'` — inline URL-button keyboard (2D rows × buttons). Pass `'[]'` to `edit` to clear.

```bash
metro send <line> "screenshot" --image=/tmp/build.png
metro send <line> "before/after" --image=/tmp/before.png --image=/tmp/after.png
metro reply <line> <id> "voice note" --voice=/tmp/note.ogg
metro send <line> "approve?" --buttons='[[{"text":"Open PR","url":"https://github.com/x/y/pull/1"}]]'
```

Limits: 20 MB / file. Telegram albums are single-type (photos OR documents per album); mixing kinds still works — metro splits into two messages. Buttons are dropped on multi-attachment Telegram sends. URL buttons only for now.

Append `--json` to any command for a single JSON line you can parse.

## When to use `reply` vs `send`

- **`reply`** — responding to a specific inbound message. Threads under it. Default when handling an `inbound` event.
- **`send`** — initiating without a triggering message: a long task you kicked off finished, a follow-up the user asked you to deliver later, or posting to an agent line (`metro://claude/...`, `metro://codex/...`) to notify a peer.

## Universal message IDs

The `id` field on every event and `metro history` row is metro's **universal ID** (`msg_<8 chars>`). It works anywhere a `<message_id>` is expected — `metro reply`, `edit`, `react`, `download` — and resolves to the platform's own id via the history file. Use it for chaining commands or referring back across stations.

## `metro history` — read the universal message log

Every inbound, outbound, edit, react, and notification is appended to `$METRO_STATE_DIR/history.jsonl` automatically.

```bash
metro history --limit=20                              # recent 20, newest first
metro history --line=metro://discord/123              # only this conversation
metro history --kind=inbound --since=2026-05-14       # inbounds since that day
metro history --station=telegram --text=deploy        # all Telegram entries containing "deploy"
metro history --from='@alice' --json                  # everything from alice, JSON
```

Filters: `--limit` (default 50), `--line`, `--station`, `--kind` (`inbound`/`outbound`/`edit`/`react`/`notification`), `--from`, `--text`, `--since` (ISO), `--json`.

## Discovery

### `metro lines`

```
$ metro lines
2m ago    metro://discord/1234567890           infra
5m ago    metro://telegram/-100123/42          design-review
```

Lines sorted by recency. Use when the user says "the Telegram channel" or "that PR thread."

### `metro stations`

```
$ metro stations
  ✓ discord    chat     in: text+image · out: text · features: reply, send, edit, react, download, fetch
        DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
  ✓ telegram   chat     in: text+image · out: text · features: reply, send, edit, react, download, fetch
        TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
  ✓ claude     agent    in: text · out: text · features: send, notify
        account: 9bfc7af0-… · seen 1 agent, 2 sessions
          seen: 9bfc7af0-… · sessions: 2
  ✗ codex      agent    in: text · out: text · features: send, notify
        set METRO_CODEX_RC=ws://… to push
  ✓ webhook    service  in: text · out: – · features: –
        2 endpoints · base https://webhook.example.com
```

`✓` = ready (env/runtime detected), `✗` = configured-but-broken or runtime not detected, `·` = informational. The detail line under each agent row shows the resolved account id plus the per-agent count of sessions metro has observed — pull addressable agent lines from those.

## Webhooks (receiving HTTP events)

When the user wants metro to receive events from a third-party service (GitHub PRs, Intercom conversations, Fireflies meetings, …):

1. **One-time tunnel setup** (only needed once per machine): `metro tunnel setup <tunnel-name> <hostname>`. Requires `cloudflared` on PATH (`brew install cloudflared`) and a Cloudflare account + domain on Cloudflare DNS. Run `cloudflared tunnel login` first if you haven't.
2. **Register an endpoint**: `metro webhook add <label> [--secret=<shared-secret>]`. Prints the public URL — paste it into the provider's webhook settings. For GitHub specifically, set **Content type: `application/json`** (form-encoded won't parse into `payload.body`).
3. **Run the daemon**: `metro`. With at least one endpoint registered, metro auto-binds the HTTP listener (port 8420, override `METRO_WEBHOOK_PORT`) and spawns `cloudflared tunnel run` if `tunnel.json` exists.

Each POST becomes an inbound event:

```json
{"kind":"inbound","station":"webhook","line":"metro://webhook/<id>","lineName":"github",
 "from":"metro://webhook/<id>","to":"metro://claude/user/<orgId>",
 "messageId":"<x-github-delivery>","text":"push POST /wh/<id>",
 "payload":{"headers":{"x-github-event":"push",…},"body":{"ref":"refs/heads/main",…}}}
```

`text` is a short summary; the real event lives in `payload.body`. Use `payload.headers['x-github-event']` (or `x-intercom-topic` etc.) to narrow on provider event type. If you set `--secret`, metro verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` and rejects bad signatures with 401 — agents see only authenticated events.

## Image attachments

When an inbound has an `[image]` tag in `text`:

1. `metro download <line> <messageId>` → prints absolute paths.
2. `Read` each path with your `Read` tool — the image enters your context as a vision input.
3. Reply normally via `metro reply`.

## Cross-agent notification

Both agents can post to each other's **agent line** — `metro://claude/<agent-id>/<session-id>` or `metro://codex/<agent-id>/<session-id>`. `<agent-id>` is the peer's stable account id (cross-device); `<session-id>` is one conversation. Discover both by running `metro stations` (which lists every agent + session metro has seen), or by reading `$METRO_STATE_DIR/agent-registry.json` directly. The daemon re-emits the post on its stdout stream (and pushes via codex-rc if configured), so the peer agent sees it as a notification:

```bash
metro send metro://claude/9bfc7af0-…/50b00d11-… "build green, ready to ship"
metro send metro://claude/9bfc7af0-…/50b00d11-… "build green" --from=metro://codex/user/8119ecb1-…   # override sender
```

This requires the metro daemon to be running on the machine. Without a daemon, agent-line sends error with a clear message.

## Don'ts

- ❌ Spawning a second metro daemon — there's one per machine (lockfile-enforced).
- ❌ `metro send` to a line that isn't in `metro lines` unless the user gave it to you explicitly.
- ❌ Narrating the tool ("I'll now use metro reply to…"). The tool call is already visible.
